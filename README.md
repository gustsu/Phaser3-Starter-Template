# Phaser 3 Starter Template

This is a Phaser 3 starter template / boiler plate. It includes live reload via webpack 4, ES6 support, loading images via import module and a simple project structure. The phaser code is a combination of various repos and the webpack setup is taken straight from the photostorm phaser3 project template. Big thanks and credit to https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template and https://github.com/snowbillr/phaser3-webpack-es6-dev-starter
